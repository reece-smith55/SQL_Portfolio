-- Original Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/us-healthcare-readmissions-and-mortality
-- Dataset contains information about 30-day readmission and mortality rates of U.S. hospitals. The data comes from studies taken from 7/1/2012 - 6/30/2015.
-- I cleaned the dataset before loading the data via CSV by performing the following:
    -- Removed all rows with unavailable data and footnotes.
    -- Removed all rows outside of the 7/1/2012 - 6/30/2015 measurement range.
    -- Removed the 'Location' feature to limit redundant data.
    -- Changed the 'Compared to National' feature to the national average of that measurement (integer) and added as a dimension to the 'measure' table.
    -- All primary key ID columns were changed to auto-incremented integers.

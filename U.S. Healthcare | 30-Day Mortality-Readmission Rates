-- Original Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/us-healthcare-readmissions-and-mortality
-- Dataset contains information about 30-day readmission and mortality rates of U.S. hospitals. The data comes from studies taken from 7/1/2012 - 6/30/2015.
-- I cleaned the dataset before loading the data via CSV by performing the following:
    -- Removed all rows with unavailable data and footnotes.
    -- Removed all rows outside of the 7/1/2012 - 6/30/2015 measurement range.
    -- Removed the 'Location' feature to limit redundant data.
    -- Changed the 'Compared to National' feature to the national average of that measurement (integer) and added as a dimension to the 'measure' table.
    -- All primary key ID columns were changed to auto-incremented integers.

-- Display the 10 states/territories with the highest (worst) average scores in mortality rate for COPD patients:

SELECT state, AVG(score) AS avg_score
FROM provider
JOIN study ON provider.id = study.provider_id
WHERE measure_id = 3

-- Display which states had the largest range between heart failure mortality score estimates, on average:

SELECT state, (AVG(high_estimate) - AVG(low_estimate)) AS avg_estimate_range
FROM provider
JOIN study ON provider.id = study.provider_id
WHERE measure_id = 4
GROUP BY state

-- Display each hospital in the state of Minnesota that performed a heart-failure mortality study
-- and indicate if its score is better or worse than the national average:

-- Display the average mortality rate and readmission rate for each measure by state. Do states that have higher readmission rates
-- also have higher mortality rates?
